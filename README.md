PYTHON CODE FOR ERSKINE7 BLOG:
I began learning Python 3 on June 25, 2018. That was the day I wrote: print("Hello World!")
I uploaded this project on 12/17/18. This is my first Python 3 project. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate that I have a basic
understanding of Python 3. (functions, strings, while loops, etc.). This project is from a single tutorial but I had to watch several 
tutorials to complete this project. Nonetheless, I got it done.
